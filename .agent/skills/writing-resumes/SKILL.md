- When the user provides a link to a LinkedIn profile or portfolio website.
- When the user needs to tailor their experience to a specific job description.

## Workflow
1. [ ] **Analyze Input**: Utilize the appropriate tool for the input type:
   - **PDF**: Use the `pdf` tool.
   - **Word (.docx)**: Use the `docx` tool.
   - **Excel (.xlsx)**: Use the `xlsx` tool.
   - **Images**: Use vision capabilities to read text from screenshots/photos.
   - **Web Links**: Use `read_url_content` to fetch profile data.
   - **Text/MD/TXT**: Use `view_file`.
2. [ ] **Extract Identity**: Map out the user's Core Skills, Experience (Years/Roles), Domain Expertise, and Major Projects.
3. [ ] **Refine Content**: Rewrite bullet points using the "Action Verb + Task + Result" (STAR/XYZ) formula.
4. [ ] **Format & Style**: Structure the content in Markdown, PDF, or DOCX as requested by the user.
5. [ ] **Export**: Save the final version to the user's specified path using `write_to_file` or the `docx` creation tool.

## Instructions

### 1. Analysis Logic
- **Skill Mapping**: Categorize skills into Technical (e.g., Playwright, Java), Soft (e.g., Leadership), and Domain (e.g., Fintech, Healthcare).
- **Project Deep-Dive**: Transform vague project descriptions into quantified achievements (e.g., "Improved test coverage by 40%").

### 2. Writing Principles
- **Conciseness**: Keep descriptions punchy. Avoid first-person pronouns (I, me, my).
- **ATS Optimization**: Ensure keywords from the target domain are naturally integrated.
- **Power Verbs**: Use words like *Spearheaded*, *Architected*, *Optimized*, and *Orchestrated*.

### 3. Universal File Handling
- **Non-Textual Files**: If an image is provided, perform OCR/Vision analysis first.
- **Spreadsheets**: If skills are listed in Excel, use `xlsx` tool to extract data.
- **Default Output Path**: `C:/Users/pashi/Downloads/` (Use this as the target directory unless otherwise specified).
- **Default Output Format**: **PDF** (Use the `pdf` creation tool for the final export).
- **Verification**: Always verify the target path before saving.
